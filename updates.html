        Flight 3's ascent and boostback burn went smoothly, demonstrating reliable engine performance and precise vehicle control. The booster's landing burn started nominally, but the test shutdown of one of the three center engines caused the booster to descend too rapidly, resulting in a high-velocity splashdown. Despite this, preparations for attempting a booster catch on the next flight remain on track.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        The Starship upper stage experienced a nominal ascent with no engine failures, reaching SECO without fires or malfunctions. During the coast to reentry, ice buildup in the engine intakes presented a minor risk, but the vehicle maintained stability.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        Reentry proceeded successfully, though the heat shield sustained significant damage near the forward flaps and nosecone. Despite this, the Starship survived reentry with the flaps barely intact. During the landing phase, the vehicle executed its belly flop maneuver correctly, but the engines failed to ignite, resulting in an unplanned hard splashdown.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        To prevent engine intake ice during future flights, the team is implementing improved heating and anti-icing measures on all engine inlets. Heat shield reinforcements and additional thermal insulation near the forward flaps and nosecone will be installed to reduce damage during reentry. The landing engine sequence is also being revised with updated ignition protocols and redundancy checks to ensure successful engine start during the belly flop and landing burn.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        Flight 3 provided crucial data on engine shutdown testing, reentry thermal loads, and flap survivability. These lessons will guide refinements to ensure a safe and controlled booster catch and successful Starship landings in upcoming missions.

      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        The ascent burn of Flight 2 was flawless. The booster and ship cleared the pad cleanly, accelerated smoothly through max-Q, and all engines performed nominally through the early climb to orbit.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        Following stage separation, the booster continued its mission with equal precision. Its boostback, controlled descent, and splashdown were executed without issue, marking our first ever splashdown recovery attempt and validating our landing profile.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        The Starship upper stage ascended well at first, but fires began growing in the aft section before any engine issues. The first Raptor vacuum engine started failing at 15,800 km/h and fully failed shortly after. The second vacuum engine failed at 19,500 km/h, followed by the third at 20,600 km/h. Two of the three sea-level engines failed almost simultaneously at 24,000 km/h, leaving the Starship with insufficient thrust and triggering the flight termination system.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        The cause of the ship's failure has been conclusively identified as a fault in the redesigned aft section downcomer system. The new configuration introduced unanticipated flow instabilities at high mass-flow rates, resulting in intermittent propellant starvation, engine underperformance, and uncontrolled fires. To resolve this, we are reverting to the proven legacy downcomer design while continuing development of the new version with additional baffling and reinforcement. We are also implementing redundant flow sensors, enhanced fire shielding, and improved aft-section insulation to ensure reliable propellant delivery and containment on future flights.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        Looking forward, the booster's flawless performance and successful splashdown provide a strong foundation for future recoveries. While this flight was not a catch attempt, the data gathered will be used to refine our procedures and hardware in preparation for the first booster catch in upcoming missions.

      <h4 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-1">First Flight. First Lessons.</h4>
      <img src="https://imgur.com/ZKn1j66.jpeg" alt="Update Image" class="w-1/2 rounded-lg mb-2">

      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        The Starship launch began nominally, with all 33 Raptor engines igniting successfully and the vehicle passing through Max-Q. Stage separation proceeded as planned, and the Starship upper stage lit all three of its engines without issue. Despite the challenges that followed, these moments demonstrated that critical systems such as engine ignition, stage separation, and initial upper stage operations were functioning as intended.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        The Super Heavy Booster encountered multiple setbacks after Max-Q. Three engines failed shortly after liftoff, and two of these could not relight during the boostback burn. Additional engine failures occurred throughout the boostback, leaving only three operational engines by the time the vehicle began its coast to the landing burn. At approximately 5 km altitude, the booster was lost. Structural issues were also noted, with one grid fin ripped off during Max-Q and another lost during ascent.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        The Starship upper stage initially performed well, lighting all six engines at stage separation. However, the flight ended prematurely when the vehicle exploded at 80 km altitude, traveling at roughly 11,000 km/h. While the ship completed its stage separation and engine ignition successfully, it was unable to sustain flight beyond the initial ascent phase, marking a critical failure in upper stage performance.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        Preliminary analysis suggests that the Super Heavy Booster failures were caused by a combination of engine anomalies and structural stress during ascent. The early engine shutdowns likely resulted from a fuel mixture imbalance under high dynamic pressure, compounded by the loss of two grid fins that affected vehicle stability and aerodynamic loads. To address these issues, the engineering team plans to reinforce grid fin mounts, adjust Raptor fuel delivery algorithms, and implement additional sensors to monitor engine performance in real time. These upgrades aim to ensure that the booster can survive Max-Q and maintain thrust throughout boostback and landing sequences.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
        The Starship upper stage failure appears to have been triggered by an overpressure event in one of the main propellant tanks, likely exacerbated by thermal stress and the extreme velocity of 11,000 km/h. This led to structural compromise and the subsequent explosion at 80 km altitude. To prevent a repeat, the team plans to reinforce the tank supports and upgrade the venting system to safely release excess pressure during high-speed ascent. Additional work will focus on strengthening the vehicle's aft section and optimizing engine startup sequences to reduce shock loads on the structure. These improvements aim to allow Starship to safely complete stage separation and sustain flight beyond the current altitude limits.
