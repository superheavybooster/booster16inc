          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
            The Starship launch began nominally, with all 33 Raptor engines igniting successfully and the vehicle passing through Max-Q. Stage separation proceeded as planned, and the Starship upper stage lit all six of its engines without issue. Despite the challenges that followed, these moments demonstrated that critical systems such as engine ignition, stage separation, and initial upper stage operations were functioning as intended.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
            The Super Heavy Booster encountered multiple setbacks after Max-Q. Three engines failed shortly after liftoff, and two of these could not relight during the boostback burn. Additional engine failures occurred throughout the boostback, leaving only three operational engines by the time the vehicle began its coast to the landing burn. At approximately 5 km altitude, the booster was lost. Structural issues were also noted, with one grid fin ripped off during Max-Q and another lost during ascent.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
            The Starship upper stage initially performed well, lighting all six engines at stage separation. However, the flight ended prematurely when the vehicle exploded at 80 km altitude, traveling at roughly 11 km/h. While the ship completed its stage separation and engine ignition successfully, it was unable to sustain flight beyond the initial ascent phase, marking a critical failure in upper stage performance.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
            Preliminary analysis suggests that the Super Heavy Booster failures were caused by a combination of engine anomalies and structural stress during ascent. The early engine shutdowns likely resulted from a fuel mixture imbalance under high dynamic pressure, compounded by the loss of two grid fins that affected vehicle stability and aerodynamic loads. To address these issues, the engineering team plans to reinforce grid fin mounts, adjust Raptor fuel delivery algorithms, and implement additional sensors to monitor engine performance in real time. These upgrades aim to ensure that the booster can survive Max-Q and maintain thrust throughout boostback and landing sequences.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-300 mb-10">
            The Starship upper stage failure appears to have been triggered by an overpressure event in one of the main propellant tanks, likely exacerbated by thermal stress and the extreme velocity of 11 000 km/h. This led to structural compromise and the subsequent explosion at 80 km altitude. To prevent a repeat, the team plans to reinforce the tank supports and upgrade the venting system to safely release excess pressure during high-speed ascent. Additional work will focus on strengthening the vehicle’s aft section and optimizing engine startup sequences to reduce shock loads on the structure. These improvements aim to allow Starship to safely complete stage separation and sustain flight beyond the current altitude limits.
